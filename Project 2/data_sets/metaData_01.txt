-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the arrival data, it seemed that cars lined up into 1 line and then
diverged into the 2 seperate drive thru kiosks. For all the other data,
as soon as a customer came to a complete stop at the respective station,
the timer started. Most of the time, as soon as a car started driving away,
it was assumed that the process was finished and the timer then stopped.
For a few instances, if the car had another car blocking it and preventing
it from moving, it was assumed that the process stopped as soon as the car
window rolled up indicating the end of that particular station service. It
was noticed that the arrival line never was excessive to where cars waited
to get in line. Also, there was space for 3 cars between the two order
stations and the payment station (non-inclusive). There was only space for
1 car between the payment station and pickup station (non-inclusive). For
very few instances, a car was asked to pull over to the side to wait for
the food to keep the line moving. For ease of tracking purposes, in these
rare cases, the timer was marked as finished as soon as the car moved away 
from that station.
