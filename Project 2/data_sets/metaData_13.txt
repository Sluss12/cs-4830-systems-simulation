I tracked arrival and order times from the same spot. For some reason they
closed one of their two order stations, and the order line started backing up.
I had to stop tracking arrival times after only 24 minutes because I couldn't
reliably see the end of the line. I also didn't get every order, but I figured
that was okay because we are just trying to get the distribution of order
lengths.

I tracked payments and pickups from the same spot. I would track the start/stop
time for a car to pay, and then the same car picking up their order. Then I
would track the next car to arrive to the payment window. This meant I didn't
track every single car that came through, but I got at least half of them.
