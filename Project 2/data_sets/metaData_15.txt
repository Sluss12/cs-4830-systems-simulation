Notes:

1.In the arrival queue there are no overflows(there are no exits due to overflow in my observation).
2.There is only one entry point for the arrival and then splits into two at the ordering station.
3.Three(3) cars can exactly fit in between order stations and payment window.
4.In my observation there is no space for cars in between payment and pickup window.
5.There are one or two cars waiting at the ordering staion after completing the order to join in the payment queue. 
6.In my observation it takes some time for customer to get in immediately to order station.

moving to the first in queue --> payment window (~4 sec)
