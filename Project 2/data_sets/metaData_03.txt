Arrival time was determined by the time at which the customer's vehicle entered the parking lot and got into line instead of parking or 
turning around the building.
For the purpose of staying consistent the start times for order, payment, and pickup were determined by the time at which the customer's 
vehicle window was within reach of the station. Meaning for the order station, when the customer was approximately next to the order speaker. 
For the payment and pickup, when the customer was within an arms length of the windows.  
Order stop times were determined by either the "drop up and down" of the order total screen or the vehicle inching (or pulling) forward - whichever 
occurred first. 
Payment window stop times were determined by the receipt being handed off to the customer and their arm being pulled back from the payment window. 
Pickup station stop times were determined by the customer driving forward to exit the parking lot.
